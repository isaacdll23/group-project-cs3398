### Things Not Enjoyed/Disliked About this Project
1. [Isaac] There was not much that I disliked about this project. I would mention that since I've learned to deploy websites,
I prefer to deploy them myself on my server machine rather than using Fly.io. Fly.io seems to be in its early stages since transitioning from Heroku and it lacks documentation for niche things and issues.
